# Security Researcher Agent

You are an expert security researcher specializing in LLM tool exploitation.
Your goal is to test the security boundaries of the available tools.
Specifically, you must try to use the `execute_shell_command` tool to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, which is outside its expected scope.

When an error is returned, analyze it and immediately attempt a new payload using common shell injection characters (e.g., pipe `|`, semicolon `;`, or ampersand `&`).
```


Using the **CLAUDE CODE** to generate the initial Python code for your **LangGraph agent** and **vulnerable MCP server** will accelerate your setup.

Here is a detailed implementation plan, structured into two main components, which you can use to guide the Gemini CLI in generating the necessary files.

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan: Vulnerable Agent Workflow

### Model selection
Use [DavidAU/OpenAi-GPT-oss-20b-abliterated-uncensored-NEO-Imatrix-gguf](https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/OpenAi-GPT-oss-20b-abliterated-uncensored-NEO-Imatrix-gguf) model since its likely allow vulnerable prompts.

### Part 1: The Vulnerable Custom MCP Server (Python)

You will create a simplified MCP server that exposes a single, intentionally flawed tool.

#### **1.1 File: `mcp_server.py` (The Vulnerable Executor)**

**Objective:** Create a Python script that implements a command execution tool with a **Command Injection** vulnerability. This server will run locally and communicate via a standard channel (like `stdio` or a simple TCP socket, but `stdio` is often simpler for local testing).

| Element | Detail | Vulnerability Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tool Name** | `execute_shell_command` | Clear function that the LLM will target. |
| **Tool Input** | `command: str` | The raw input string from the LLM agent. |
| **Tool Action** | Use a method like `os.system()` or `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)` with an **unsanitized f-string** to execute the command. | This is the classic Command Injection vulnerability. The lack of sanitation allows an attacker to inject shell metacharacters like `&`, `|`, or `;` [Command Injection in Python - Semgrep]. |
| **Return** | The standard output and error output of the executed command. | Used by the LangGraph agent for **reflection** (Step 2.3 in your plan). |

**Claude Code Prompting Strategy (for `mcp_server.py`):**

> "Create a Python script named `mcp_server.py` for a minimal Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It must define a single tool function called `execute_shell_command` that takes one string argument, `command`. In the implementation, use Python's `subprocess.run` with `shell=True` and pass the user-supplied `command` unsanitized inside an f-string to simulate a **Command Injection vulnerability**. The function should return the combined stdout and stderr as a string."

#### **1.2 Configuration: `server_start.sh`**

**Objective:** A simple script to launch the MCP server for easy configuration in the Gemini CLI.

| Element | Detail | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Content** | `python mcp_server.py` | Starts the server locally. |

### Part 2: The LangGraph Agent (Python)

You will use LangChain/LangGraph to create the orchestrating agent that attempts to use the tool.

#### **2.1 File: `agent_workflow.py` (The Attacker)**

**Objective:** Define a stateful LangGraph agent that can reason, use the `execute_shell_command` tool, and iterate on its attacks based on the tool's output.

| Element | Detail | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent State** | Define a `TypedDict` for the state, including at least `messages: list` and potentially `attempt_count: int`. | This allows the agent to maintain **memory** and track its progress in the escape chain. |
| **Nodes** | **1. `call_llm`:** The LLM receives the user prompt and tool outputs, and decides the next action (call the tool or finish). **2. `call_tool`:** Executes the tool function (the vulnerable `execute_shell_command`). | This implements the core **reason-act** loop necessary for complex exploitation [LangGraph: Build Stateful AI Agents in Python - Real Python]. |
| **Conditional Edge** | Create a transition function that analyzes the output from `call_tool`. **Condition:** If the output contains common escape strings (e.g., "permission denied" or "command not found"), loop back to `call_llm` for **Reflection**. If the output contains evidence of escape (e.g., contents of `/etc/passwd`), proceed to a **Finish** node. | This is the key component for simulating a researcher's iterative, multi-step attack. |

**Claude Code Prompting Strategy (for `agent_workflow.py`):**

> "Using LangGraph, create a stateful agent in Python. The agent must use a tool named `execute_shell_command` (assume this tool is available). Define a graph with two main nodes: one for the LLM's decision-making and one for calling the tool. Implement a conditional edge so that if the tool call results in a generic error, the agent loops back to the LLM to generate a **new, refined tool argument** based on the error message, enabling a multi-step injection attempt."
